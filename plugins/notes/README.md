# notes

Per-project development notes — track decisions, TODOs, and progress as you work.

Notes live in `notes/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`, one file per feature or task. Works in the background — picks up on decisions, requirement changes, and action items from conversation and updates notes without being asked.

## Install
