# productivity

Dev notes and personal task management in one skill. Tracks decisions, TODOs, and progress per feature in `notes/` files, and manages cross-project tasks, reminders, and recurring routines in a personal docket.

Works in the background — picks up on decisions, deadlines, and action items from conversation. Reads your docket at session start, executes recurring routines, and keeps things tidy.

Configurable via `~/.claude/squire.json` for docket location and recurring routines. Additional commands: `/productivity status`, `/productivity retry <routine>`, `/productivity clean`.
