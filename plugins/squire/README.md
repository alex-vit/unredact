# squire

Personal assistant that tracks tasks, reminders, and deadlines across all projects and sessions. Works in the background — reads your docket at session start, picks up on tasks and deadlines mentioned in conversation, and keeps things tidy without being asked.

Just work as usual. The squire notices when tasks come up, decisions get made, or deadlines are mentioned, and offers to track them. It also executes recurring routines, delegates to other skills, and prunes stale items.

Configurable via `~/.claude/squire.json` — set your todos file location and define recurring routines with skills to invoke.

## Install
